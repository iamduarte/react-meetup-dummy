# [Dummy Meetup App](https://ozzypt.github.io/react-meetup-dummy)

This dummy app was done as a React refresh as part of a Next.js & React course on Udemy that can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/).

With this App I learned some new concepts such as useContext hook, using React Router, using POST and GET requests with a simple Firebase API / Database.
